# Checkers by Lucas Albano and Steven Nissley Jr

## House Rules:
1. To win, players must eliminate all opponents checker pieces! First player to lose all their checker pieces loses the game!
2. If a checker piece is selected and has a jump move available then it must take it, you may select another piece if you do not desire to make the jump move
3. Only diagonal double jumps are allowed (for both standard and king pieces)

## Features:
1. You have the ability to create a player with your own name or nickname
2. You have the ability to save your current game and load it back on when you run the program again at a later time
3. After completion of a game, wins will be stored on a leaderboard next to the player's name
